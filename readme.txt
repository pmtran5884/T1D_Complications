The raw data file is "2_T1DComplications data_cleaned for Paul.csv"
The code to process the data and create the risk models is "Paul_draft_v4.Rmd"
The code to generate the Shiny App Web Interface (https://ptran25.shinyapps.io/Diabetic_Peripheral_Neuropathy_Risk) is in the "Shiny App" folder.

The manuscript describing the methods will be submitted for publication soon.
